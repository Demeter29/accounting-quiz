35) Describe management accounting and financial accounting.
Answer: Management accounting provides information to internal decision makers of the business such
as top executives, managers, sales representatives, and production supervisors. Its purpose is to help
managers predict and evaluate future results. Reports are generated often and usually broken down into
smaller reporting divisions such as department or product line. There are no rules to be complied with
since these reports are for internal use only. Management accounting embraces more extensively such
topics as the development and implementation of strategies and policies, budgeting, special studies and
forecasts, influence on employee behavior, and nonfinancial as well as financial information.
Financial accounting, by contrast, provides information to external decision makers such as investors
and creditors. Its purpose is to present a fair picture of the financial condition of the company. Reports
are generated quarterly or annually and report on the company as a whole. The financial statements must
comply with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). A CPA audits, or verifies, that the
GAAP are being followed.

Objective: 1
AACSB: Reflective thinking
36) Is financial accounting or management accounting more useful to an operations manager? Why?
Answer: Management accounting is more useful to an operations manager because management
accounting reports operating results by department or unit rather than for the company as a whole, it
includes financial as well as nonfinancial data such as on-time deliveries and cycle times, and it includes
quantitative as well as qualitative data such as the type of rework that was needed on defective units.

37) Is it possible to have an active cost management program without an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) System?
Answer: Yes, an active cost management program can occur without an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) System. Cost management is a philosophy that guides management in their short-run and longrun planning and control decisions that increase value for customers and lower costs of products and
services. Cost management is not dependent on any particular system or database, but it is rather an
overall philosophy of operation.

38) What competitive advantage could a company obtain from a successful cost management program?
Answer: There are three broad outcomes from a successful cost management program: 1) costs are
reduced with no loss in customer value. In this scenario, a company might gain a competitive advantage
by lowering its price with no loss in profit, or maintain the same price and increase profit; 2) customer
value is increased with no change in costs. This scenario might increase customer satisfaction resulting
in increased customer loyalty and perhaps increase the overall demand for the product; 3) customer
value might be increased while costs are reduced simultaneously. This scenario would result in the
benefits described in both 1) and 2).

22) Generally, companies follow one of two broad strategies: offering a quality product at a low price,
or offering a unique product or service priced higher than the competition. Is it possible to follow a
strategy that is "in the middle"?
Answer: There is some dispute about the correct answer to this question. Some will argue that it is not
good for companies to get "caught in the middle" because the customer might get confused as to whether
or not the company is competing on price or is trying to make some other appeal. If the customer is
confused about how the company is giving them value, they might perceive they are getting no value
and abandon the product to a competitor with a clearer customer value proposition. The other side of the
argument is that cost management is a necessary part of any strategy and even if the company chooses to
pursue a differential strategy, management of the company should always be seeking ways to manage
costs and increase customer value simultaneously regardless of their strategy. The student should be able
to articulate one or the other arguments coherently.

The overall 3.75% unfavorable difference in advertising revenue is caused by offsetting differences in
advertising pages sold (favorable) and the average rate per page (unfavorable). The performance report
highlights the favorable increase in the advertising pages sold. While the percentage drop in advertising
revenue per page is also dramatic, management might want to investigate the reasons behind such a
drop. Some possibilities include: aggressive price reductions to obtain revenue, or some aggressive
competition, or an unrealistic budget.

12) Discuss the potential behavior implications of performance evaluation.
Answer: As measurements are made on operations and, especially, on individuals and groups, the
behavior of the individuals and groups are affected. People react to the measurements being made. They
will focus on those variables or the behavior being measured and spend less attention on variables and
behavior that are not measured. In addition, if managers attempt to introduce or redesign cost and
performance measurement systems, people familiar with the previous system will resist. Management
accountants must understand and anticipate the reactions of individuals to information and
measurements. The design and introduction of new measurements and systems must be accompanied
with an analysis of the likely reactions to the innovations.

suspect that your immediate supervisor is involved in a significant fraud involving diverting of company
assets to personal use. Briefly describe the steps you might take to resolve this dilemma.
Answer: The management accountant should first consult any internal company procedures concerning
the resolution of ethical issues, and make sure these procedures are followed as closely as possible. At
the same time, the management accountant should make sure that the facts are accurate, and are not
based on rumors or inaccurate information. If these policies do not resolve the situation, present the facts
to the next higher managerial level. Clarify the relevant ethical issues with an objective advisor (e.g.,
Institute of Management Accountants hotline). Consult your own attorney to be aware of your own
rights and responsibilities. If all internal review procedures have still not resolved the ethical situation,
the managerial accountant might have to resign and write an informative letter to an appropriate
representative of the organization, and perhaps notify other parties.

23) Why is it possible that a raw material such as glue might be considered as an indirect material for
one furniture manufacturer and as a direct material for another furniture manufacture?
Answer: It is possible for a raw material such as glue to be considered as an indirect material by one
furniture manufacturer and as a direct material by another furniture manufacturer. The decision is
largely a choice by the manufacturer and depends on a number of factors including the materiality of the
cost in question, the cost of gathering the information, and the design of the manufacturing process. If
the product in question has an insignificant cost, it might not be worth the trouble to trace the cost of the
glue to each piece of furniture, and the glue would be considered indirect. If the cost of tracing the cost
of the glue is high in relation to the benefits received from tracing it, the glue would likely be considered
as indirect material. If the design of the manufacturing process easily permits all the glue to be traced to
a single type of furniture, then it would be easy for a company to consider that material to be direct.
Overall, the direct/indirect classification is decided on a cost/benefit basis.

24) What are the differences between direct costs and indirect costs? Give an example of each.
Answer: Direct costs are costs that can be traced easily to the product manufactured or the service
rendered. Examples of direct costs include direct materials and direct manufacturing labor used in a
product. Indirect costs cannot be easily identified with individual products or services rendered, and are
usually assigned using allocation formulas. In a plant that manufactures multiple products, examples of
indirect costs include the plant supervisor's salary and the cost of machines used to produce more than
one type of product.

33) Describe a variable cost. Describe a fixed cost. Explain why the distinction between variable and
fixed costs is important in cost accounting.
Answer: Total variable costs increase with increased production or sales volumes.
Fixed costs are not influenced by fluctuations in production or sales volumes.
Without the knowledge of cost behaviors, budgets and other forecasting tools will be inaccurate and
unreliable. Understanding whether a cost behaves as a variable or a fixed cost is essential to estimating
and planning for business success.

91) Springfield Manufacturing produces electronic storage devices, and uses the following three-part
classification for its manufacturing costs: direct materials, direct manufacturing labor, and indirect
manufacturing costs. Total indirect manufacturing costs for January were $300 million, and were
allocated to each product on the basis of direct manufacturing labor costs of each line. Summary data (in
millions) for January for the most popular electronic storage device, the Big Bertha, was:
Direct manufacturing costs
Direct manufacturing labor costs
Indirect manufacturing costs
Units produced

Big Bertha
$4,500,000
$1,500,000
$4,250,000
40,000

Required:
a. Compute the manufacturing cost per unit for each product produced in January.
b. Suppose production will be reduced to 30,000 units in February. Speculate as to whether the unit
costs in February will most likely be higher or lower than unit costs in January; it is not necessary to
calculate the exact February unit cost. Briefly explain your reasoning.
Answer:
a. Unit costs for January were:
($4,500,000 + $1,500,000 + $4,250,000) / 40,000 = $256.25 per unit
b. Unit costs should be higher in February if only 30,000 units are to be produced. Indirect
manufacturing costs most likely include both fixed and variable components. Since fewer units are
expected to be produced in February, total fixed costs will be spread over fewer units. This will result in
an increase in total cost per unit since variable costs per unit will most likely not change with the
decreased production.

102) Explain the difference between an inventoriable cost and a period cost. What potential problems
does an inaccurate classification of product and period costs cause?
Answer: Inventoriable costs are all costs of a product that are considered as assets in the balance sheet
when they are incurred and which become cost of goods sold only when the product is sold. Period costs
are treated as expenses of the accounting period in which they are incurred. An inaccurate classification
of inventoriable and period costs could lead to violations of the matching principle, which states that
costs used in producing revenue should be matched on the income statement when the revenue is
recognized. In extreme cases, net income for a given period might be significantly misstated if proper
matching does not occur.

increase in sales. If this proposed reduction in selling price is implemented:
A) operating income will decrease by $9,000
B) operating income will increase by $9,000
C) operating income will decrease by $20,000
D) operating income will increase by $15,000
Answer: A
Explanation: A) Original contribution margin per unit $75 x 1,000 units = $75,000 - $60,000 fixed costs
= Operating Income $15,000
$100 - 20% = $80 new sales price per unit
$80 - $25 = $55 new contribution margin per unit
1,000 units + 20% increase in sales = 1,200 units
$55 x 1,200 units = $66,000 - $60,000 fixed costs = $6,000 new operating income

$300,000. In 2012, the company expects annual property taxes to decrease by $15,000.
Required:
a. Calculate operating income and the breakeven point for 2011.
b. Calculate the breakeven point for 2012.
Answer:
a. In 2011, operating income is $800,000 sales revenue - $200,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed
costs = $300,000.
The breakeven point for 2011 is $400,000 in total sales dollars.
$600,000 CM / $800,000 sales revenue = 0.75 CM ratio. $300,000 total fixed costs / 0.75 CM ratio =
$400,000 in total sales to break even.
b. The breakeven point for 2012 is $380,000 in total sales dollars.
$300,000 fixed costs - $15,000 reduction in property taxes = $285,000 estimated fixed costs for

21) Query Company sells pillows for $25.00 each. The manufacturing cost, all variable, is $10 per
pillow. The company is planning on renting an exhibition booth for both display and selling purposes at
the annual crafts and art convention. The convention coordinator allows three options for each
participating company. They are:
1.
paying a fixed booth fee of $5,010, or
2.
paying an $4,000 fee plus 10% of revenue made at the convention, or
3.
paying 20% of revenue made at the convention.
Required:
a. Compute the breakeven sales in pillows of each option.
b. Which option should Query Company choose, assuming sales are expected to be 800 pillows?
Answer:
a. Option 1 N = Breakeven in pillows
$25N - $10N - $5,010 = 0
$15N - $5,010 = 0
N = $5,010/$15 = 334 pillows
Option 2 N = Breakeven in pillows
$25N - $10N - 0.10($25N) - $4,000 = 0
$12.5N - $4,000 = 0
N = $4,000/$12.5 = 320 pillows
Option 3 N = Breakeven in pillows
$25N - $10N - 0.20($25N) = 0
$10N - $0 = 0
N = $0/$10 = 0 pillows
b. Option 1 profit for 800 pillows = $15 × 800 - $5,010 = $6,990
Option 2 profit for 800 pillows = $12.5 × 800 - 4,000 = $6,000
Option 3 profit for 800 pillows = $10 × 800 = $8,000
Option 3 is the best choice.

22) Auto Tires has been in the tire business for four years. It rents a building but owns all of its
equipment. All employees are paid a fixed salary except for the busy season (April-June), when
temporary help is hired by the hour. Utilities and other operating charges remain fairly constant during
each month except those in the busy season.
Selling prices per tire average $75 except during the busy season. Because a large number of customers
buy tires prior to winter, discounts run above average during the busy season. A 15% discount is given
when two tires are purchased at one time. During the busy months, selling prices per tire average $60.
The president of Auto Tires is somewhat displeased with the company's management accounting system
because the cost behavior patterns displayed by the monthly breakeven charts are inconsistent; the busy
months' charts are different from the other months of the year. The president is never sure if the
company has a satisfactory margin of safety or if it is just above the breakeven point.
Required:
a. What is wrong with the accountant's computations?
b. How can the information be presented in a better format for the president?
Answer:
a. The accounting system includes some assumptions about the CVP model that does not hold for Auto
Tire. The CVP model requires cost and revenue to be linear. During the busy months, the company has
costs and revenues which behave differently than during the other months of the year. The revenue line
turns down (less slope) with the average selling price per tire decreasing from $75 to $60. The variable
costs line probably turns upward (increasing slope) with the additional hourly workers being added to
the work force.
b. The accountant may want to present two sets of information regarding the revenue and cost
behaviors of the company: one for the busy season and one for the other months of the year. It would
show that while the breakeven point actually increases during the busy months (a negative), the marginal
income increases because of increased sales (a positive).

23) Dolph and Evan started the DE Restaurant in 20X3. They rented a building, bought equipment, and
hired two employees to work full time at a fixed monthly salary. Utilities and other operating charges
remain fairly constant during each month.
During the past two years, the business has grown with average sales increasing 1% a month. This
situation pleases both Dolph and Evan, but they do not understand how sales can grow by 1% a month
while profits are increasing at an even faster pace. They are afraid that one day they will wake up to
increasing sales but decreasing profits.
Required:
Explain why the profits have increased at a faster rate than sales. Use the terms variable costs and fixed
costs in your response.
Answer: The fixed cost per meal served is decreasing with increased volumes, while the contribution
margin per meal served remains constant. Apparently, most of the restaurant's expenses are fixed.
Therefore, as sales pass the breakeven point the profit will increase even faster because the fixed
expenses have already been covered. This allows sales to cover only variable expenses before
contributing to the profit margin, thereby causing it to increase at a faster rate.

25) Suppose a company decided to automate a production line. Explain what effects this would have on
a company's cost structure using CVP terminology. Could these changes have any possible negative
effect on the firm?
Answer: An automated production line would increase fixed costs through extra depreciation on the
new machinery and also decrease variable costs due to the elimination of direct labor as a result of
automation. This would increase the breakeven point. This could possibly have a negative effect on the
firm if demand for the product produced by this production line is expected to decline in the future. With
high fixed costs and low demand, a decline in profits might be more severe due to the presence of
unchanging fixed costs as volume drops.

an arrangement is $30 and the average cost of each sale is $18. A new mall is opening where Karen
wants to locate a store, but the location manager is not sure about the rent method to accept. The mall
operator offers the following three options for its retail store rentals:
1. paying a fixed rent of $15,000 a month, or
2. paying a base rent of $9,000 plus 10% of revenue received, or
3. paying a base rent of $4,800 plus 20% of revenue received up to a maximum rent of $25,000.
Required:
a. For each option, compute the breakeven sales and the monthly rent paid at break-even.
b. Beginning at zero sales, show the sales levels at which each option is preferable up to 5,000 units.
Answer:
a. Option 1 N = Breakeven units
$30N - $18N - $15,000 = 0
$12N - $15,000 = 0
N = $15,000/$12 = 1,250 units

$9N - $9,000 = 0
N = $9,000/$9 = 1,000 units
Rent at breakeven = $9,000 + (0.10 × $30 × 1,000) = $12,000
Option 3 N = Breakeven units
$30N - $18N - 0.20($30N) - $4,800 = 0
$6N - $4,800 = 0
N = $4,800/$6 = 800 units
Rent at breakeven = $4,800 + (0.20 × $30 × 800) = $9,600

$9,000 with sales of $50,000, fixed costs of $21,000, and variable costs of $0.64 per hot dog.
Next year, the company plans to start selling nachos for $3 per unit. Nachos will have a variable cost of
$0.72 and new equipment and personnel to produce nachos will increase monthly fixed costs by $8,808.
Initial sales of nachos should total 5,000 units. Most of the nacho sales are anticipated to come from
current hot dog purchasers, therefore, monthly sales of hot dogs are expected to decline to $20,000.
After the first year of nacho sales, the company president believes that hot dog sales will increase to
$33,750 a month and nacho sales will increase to 7,500 units a month.
Required:
a. Determine the monthly breakeven sales in dollars before adding nachos.
b. Determine the monthly breakeven sales during the first year of nachos sales, assuming a constant
sales mix of 1 hotdog and 2 units of nachos.
Answer:
a. Contribution margin= Fixed costs + Profit
= $21,000 + $9,000 = $30,000
Variable costs

= Sales - Contribution margin
= $50,000 - $30,000
= $20,000

Units sold = $20,000/$0.64 = 31,250 units
Selling price = $50,000/31,250 = $1.60 per unit
Unit Variable costs = $20,000/31,250= $0.64
N = Breakeven units
$1.60N - $0.64N - $21,000 = 0
$0.96N - $21,000 = 0
N = $21,000/$0.96 = 21,875 units
b. Ratio equal to 1 hot dog to 2 units of nachos.
N = Breakeven number of units of hot dogs
2N = Breakeven number of units of nachos
$3(2)N + $1.60N - $0.72(2N) - $0.64N - $29,808 = 0
$7.60N - $2.08N - $29,808 = 0
N = $29,808/$5.52 = 5,400 hot dogs
Therefore, 5,400 hot dogs and 10,800 units of nachos need to be sold to break even.

$73,500, facing a tax rate of 30%?
Answer:
a. N = breakeven in product B 2N = breakeven in product A
($40 × 2N) + ($50 × N) - ($24 × 2N) - ($40 × N) - $840,000 = 0
($130 × N) - ($88 × N) - $840,000 = 0
$42N - $840,000 = 0
N = $840,000 / $42 = 20,000
Therefore, to break even, 40,000 units of Product A and 20,000 units of Product B need to be sold.
b. The breakeven point would be the same. At the breakeven point there is no pre-tax income, so the
tax rate change is irrelevant in this situation.
c. N = number of units of product B 2N = number of units of product A
($40 × 2N) + ($50 × N) - ($24 × 2N) - ($40 × N) - $840,000 =
$73,500 / (1 - .3)
($130 × N) - ($88 × N) - $840,000 = $105,000
$42N - $945,000 = 0
N = $945,000 / $42 =22,500
Therefore, to meet the profit goal, 2 × N = 45,000 units of Product A and N = 22,500 units of Product B
need to be sold.

Atlanta Radio Supply sells three units of Product X for each two units it sells of Product Y. Atlanta
Radio Supply has a tax rate of 25%.
Required:
a. What is the breakeven point in units for each product, assuming the sales mix is 3 units of Product X
for each two units of Product Y?
b. How many units of each product would be sold if Atlanta Radio Supply desired an after-tax net
income of $210,000, using its tax rate of 25%?
Answer:
a. 3N = breakeven in product X 2N = breakeven in product Y
($25 - $20) × 3N + ($45 - $35) x 2N - $350,000 = 0
$15N + $20N- $350,000 = 0
$35N - $350,000 = 0
N = $350,000 / $35 = 10,000
Therefore, to break even, 30,000 (10,000 x 3) units of Product X and 20,000 (10,000 x 2) units of
Product Y need to be sold.
b. 3N = number of units of product X 2N = number of units of product Y
($25 - $20) × 3N + ($45 - $35) x 2N - $350,000 = $210,000 / (1 - .25)
$15N + $20N- $350,000 = $280,000
$35N- $350,000 = $280,000
$35N - $630,000 = 0
N = $630000 / $35 = 18,000
Therefore, to meet the profit goal, 3 × N = 54,000 units of Product X and 2 x N = 36,000 units of
Product Y need to be sold.

26) Pennsylvania Valve Company makes three types of valves: Speedy Flow, Sure Flow, and Fine Flow.
Each of the three products has a different contribution margin, and the proportions of the three products
sold have remained steady over the years. How could Pennsylvania valve compute a breakeven point
given this situation?
Answer: Pennsylvania Valve could consider that it makes a single composite product that represents all
three products given the constant sales mix. For example, if the ratio is 3 Speedy, 2 Sure Flow, and 1
Fine Flow, Pennsylvania Valve could calculate a weighted average contribution margin for the
composite product based on the contribution margins of the individual products using the relative sales
mix as weights. Pennsylvania Valve could then divide the fixed costs by this composite contribution
margin to determine how many composite units would be needed to be sold to cover the fixed costs.
Then the sales mix could be used to determine how many units of each real product is in each composite
units. Thus, if 10,000 composite units were required to breakeven and the sales mix is 3 Speedy, 2 Sure
Flow, and 1 Fine Flow, Pennsylvania Valve would need to sell 30,000 units of Speedy, 20,000 units of
Sure Flow and 10,000 units of Fine Flow to breakeven.

Mount Carmel sells two units of Product A for each unit it sells of Product B. Mount Carmel faces a tax
rate of 30%. Mount Carmel desires a net after-tax income of $73,500. The breakeven point in units
would be:
A) 21,750 units of Product A and 43,500 units of Product B
B) 22,500 units of Product A and 45,000 units of product B
C) 43,500 units of Product A and 21,750 units of Product B
D) 45,000 units of Product A and 22,500 units of Product B
Answer: D
Explanation: D) Desired pre-tax net income $73,500 / (1.0 - .3) = $105,000
Weighted contribution margin [2 × ($40 - $24)] + [1 × ($50 - $40)] = $42
Breakeven point in composite units is ($105,000 + $840,000) / $42 = 22,500
22,500 composite units is (2 × 22,500) = 45,000 units of A and

16) Lauren had been a manager of a major hotel chain for 15 years. Due to a hotel owner's illness,
Lauren was offered the opportunity to purchase a hotel near a vacation area she had often visited. After
obtaining a lawyer and an accountant to assist her, Lauren did an analysis of the business and evaluated
several contingencies relating to various scenarios that might occur based on economic and weather
season circumstances. Since the expected monetary value of the various scenarios was much higher than
the price of the hotel, she decided to purchase the hotel. She resigned her position, obtained a loan, and
purchased the hotel. The following year, there was a severe economic downturn and also a very bad
weather season that reduced the number of guests and also caused a resulting mold situation in the hotel
building that required expensive repair work. Lauren ran short of cash, became emotionally distraught,
and eventually had to sell the hotel at a significant loss. Was it a bad decision for her to purchase the
hotel instead of keeping her other managerial position? Explain.

Answer: It was not necessarily a bad decision for Lauren to purchase the hotel. Decisions are made
based on information that is available at the time of evaluating and making the decision. By definition,
the nature of uncertainty rules out any guarantees regarding the specific outcome that will be obtained.
There are some cases where a bad outcome is obtained even when a good decision has been made.
Although the best protection against a bad outcome is a good decision, you can never be 100% certain of
a good outcome.

Answer: An actual cost system is one that traces direct costs to a cost object by using the actual directcost rates times the actual quantities of direct-cost inputs, and allocates indirect costs based on the actual
indirect cost rates times the actual quantities of the cost-allocation bases. A normal cost system is one
that traces direct costs to a cost object by using the actual direct-cost rates times the actual quantities of
direct-cost inputs, and allocates indirect costs based on the budgeted indirect cost rates times the actual
quantities of the cost-allocation bases. Both systems trace direct costs to jobs the same way. An actual
cost system traces indirect costs to jobs using actual indirect cost rates, but a normal cost system uses
budgeted indirect cost rates to trace indirect costs to jobs.

28) Hill Manufacturing uses departmental cost driver rates to apply manufacturing overhead costs to
products. Manufacturing overhead costs are applied on the basis of machine-hours in the Machining
Department and on the basis of direct labor-hours in the Assembly Department. At the beginning of
20X5, the following estimates were provided for the coming year:
Direct labor-hours
Machine-hours
Direct labor cost
Manufacturing overhead costs

Machining
Assembly
10,000 dlh
90,000 dlh
100,000 mh
5,000 mh
$ 80,000
$720,000
$250,000

The accounting records of the company show the following data for Job #846:
Direct labor-hours
Machine-hours
Direct material cost
Direct labor cost

Machining
50 dlh
170 mh
$2,700
$ 400

Assembly
120 dlh
10 mh
$1,600
$ 900

Required:
a. Compute the manufacturing overhead allocation rate for each department.
b. Compute the total cost of Job #846.
c. Provide possible reasons why Hill Manufacturing uses two different cost allocation rates.
Answer:
a. Machining Department cost-allocation rate: $2.50 / mh = $250,000/100,000 mh
Assembly Department cost-allocation rate: $4.00 / dlh = $360,000/90,000 dlh
b. Total cost of Job #846 is $6,505 = Direct materials $4,300 + Direct labor $1,300 + Manufacturing
overhead costs $905 (Machining $425 + Assembly $480).
c. Ideally, the cost-allocation base should reflect the factors that cause manufacturing overhead costs to
increase. Apparently, Hill regards the use of machines as the principal cause of manufacturing overhead
costs (such as depreciation and repairs) in the Machining Department. In contrast, Hill regards direct
labor-hours as the principal cause of manufacturing overhead costs (such as indirect labor) in the
Assembly Department.

49) In a job-costing system, explain why it is necessary to apply indirect costs to production through the
use of a manufacturing overhead cost allocation rate.
Answer: First, actual manufacturing overhead costs are not known until the end of year. To price and
invoice jobs in a timely manner, annual manufacturing overhead costs need to be estimated and
allocated to specific jobs during the accounting period. Secondly, manufacturing overhead costs are
usually not incurred evenly throughout the year. The use of a manufacturing overhead cost allocation
rate evenly distributes manufacturing overhead costs over the entire year.
Diff: 2
Terms: budgeted indirect-cost rate
Objective: 3, 4, 5, 6
AACSB: Reflective thinking
50) Why does the manufacturing overhead control account (debit) need to equal the manufacturing
overhead allocated account (credit)?
Answer: If these accounts do not equal, then overhead has either been overallocated or underallocated.
Either situation means that the cost of the cost object has not been correctly estimated during the period.
Evaluation of profitability will be incorrect depending on the materiality of the difference between the
two accounts.

51) What are three possible ways to dispose of underallocated or overallocated overhead costs at the end
of a fiscal year? Briefly comment on the theoretical correctness or incorrectness of each method.
Answer: One way to dispose of underallocated or overallocated overhead costs at the end of a fiscal
year would be to prorate the underallocated or overallocated overhead costs to the work-in-process
control account, the finished goods control account, and to the cost of goods sold account based on the
relative amounts in each account. This is a theoretically correct method since it is reasonable to believe
that the underallocated or overallocated overhead costs should attach themselves to the goods as they are
produced. A second way to dispose of the underallocated or overallocated overhead costs at the end of a
fiscal year would be to adjust the allocation rate based on the actual amounts and reallocate the overhead
to completed jobs. This is also a theoretically correct method. A third way is to clear all underallocated
or overallocated overhead to the cost of goods sold account. This is not theoretically valid but it is
practical if the amount of underallocated or overallocated overhead is not material.

29) Hammond and Jarrett provide tax consulting for estates and trusts. Their job-costing system has a
single direct-cost category (professional labor) and a single indirect-cost pool (research support). The
indirect-cost pool contains all the costs except direct personnel costs. All budgeted indirect costs are
allocated to individual jobs using actual professional labor-hours.
Required:
a. Discuss the reasons a consulting firm might use a normal costing system rather than an actual costing
system.
b. What might be some reasons for the firm to change from a one-pool to a multiple-pool allocation
concept?
Answer:
a. Budget rates are normally used because actual costs may not be available until some time after a job
is completed. Decisions about billing a client for services rendered generally must be made immediately
after the job is completed. Also, actual costs may reflect short-run changes in the environment that may
distort the billing process. Budgeted costs are affected by weekly or monthly fluctuations and, therefore,
offer a stable comparison and assignment of costs throughout the accounting cycle.
b. Having separate professional labor-hour rates assists in assigning the personnel costs to jobs closest
to their real values. This helps to maintain different costs for jobs that have the same number of hours
but a different mix of professionals doing the job. Seldom is there only one cause-and-effect relationship
between a job and the tasks performed on the job; therefore, it may also be a good idea to develop
multiple indirect-cost assignments (i.e., one for staff support and others for such items as computer
support or general administrative support).

10) What are the factors that are causing many companies to refine their costing systems to obtain more
accurate measures of the costs of their products?
Answer: The first cause is increasing product diversity. Companies are producing many more products
than they used to, placing strains on more simple, older cost systems. A second cause is the overall
increased in indirect costs and the relative decline of direct costs. The indirect nature of these costs
requires allocation, and any inaccuracies in allocation of these costs become magnified as these indirect
costs increase. A third cause would be advances in information technology that makes complex
allocation of indirect costs less burdensome. Finally, increased competition from both national and
international competitors has resulted in more pressure to reduce costs, as well as increasing the need for
and value of information to support responses to these new threats.

34) Explain how activity-based costing systems can provide more accurate product costs than traditional
cost systems.
Answer: A key reason for assigning indirect costs using an ABC system rather than a traditional system
is that ABC cost systems reflect differences required by different processes. Activity-based costing
systems provide better product costs when they identify and cost more indirect cost differences among
products. Activity-based costing seeks to distinguish batch-level, product-sustaining, and facilitysustaining costs especially when they are not proportionate to one another.
Unit-level drivers in traditional cost systems distort product costs because, effectively, these systems
assume that all indirect activities affect all products. Thus, these systems assign each unit of product an
average cost that fails to recognize the specific activities that are required to produce that product.
Activity-based costing differs from traditional costing systems in that products are not cross-subsidized
by support costs being shared by everyone. Activity-based costing is more likely to result in major
differences from traditional costing systems if the firm manufactures multiple products rather than only
one product.

Answer: Unit-level measures can distort product costing because the demand for indirect activities may

distortions are larger when the traditional systems' unit-level cost drivers and the alternative activity-cost
drivers differ proportionately more from each other. Traditional systems are likely to undercost products
with lower production volumes (relatively fewer units of production) and overcost products with higher
production volumes (relatively greater units of production).

17) What are the four parts of the cost hierarchy. Briefly explain each part, and contrast this cost
hierarchy to the fixed-variable dichotomy?
Answer: The four parts of the cost hierarchy are output unit-level costs, batch-level costs, product (or
service) sustaining costs, and facility sustaining costs. Output unit-level costs are costs of activities
performed on each individual unit of a product or service. Batch-level costs are the costs of activities
related to a group of units of products or services rather than to each individual unit of product or
service. Product (or service) sustaining costs are the costs of activities undertaken to support individual
products or services regardless of the number of units or batches in which the products are produced.
Facility-sustaining costs are the costs of activities that cannot be traced to individual products or services
but support the organization as a whole. When compared to the fixed-variable dichotomy, which
considers only units of output as a cost driver, the four part cost hierarchy provides opportunity to model
many different cost drivers. For example, batch-level costs and product (or service) sustaining costs are
driven by the number of batches of a product and the number of different products. Neither of these
class of cost drivers are able to be considered in a simple fixed-variable dichotomy.

Assume a traditional costing system applies the $160,000 of overhead costs based on direct labor hours.
a. What is the total amount of overhead costs assigned to the standard model?
b. What is the total amount of overhead costs assigned to the deluxe model?
Assume an activity-based costing system is used and that the number of setups and the number of

c. What is the total amount of overhead costs assigned to the standard model?
d. What is the total amount of overhead costs assigned to the deluxe model?
e. Explain the difference between the costs obtained from the traditional costing system and the ABC
system. Which system provides a better estimate of costs? Why?
Answer:
a. [$160,000 / (650 + 150)] × 650 = $130,000
b. [$160,000 / (650 + 150)] × 150 = $30,000
c. Setups: $40,000 / (3 + 7) = $4,000
Components: $120,000 / (30 + 50) = $1,500

d. ($4,000 × 7) + ($1,500 × 50) = $103,000
e. Because the products do not all require the same proportionate shares of the overhead resources of
setup hours and components, the ABC system provides different results than the traditional system
which allocates overhead costs on the basis of direct labor hours. The ABC system considers some
important differences in overhead resource requirements and thus provides a better picture of the costs

Required:
a. Using the current system, what is the estimated
1. total cost of manufacturing one unit for each type of door?
2. profit per unit for each type of door?
b. Using the current system, estimated manufacturing overhead costs per unit are less for the deluxe
door ($80 per unit) than the standard door ($120 per unit). What is a likely explanation for this?
c. Review the machine-related costs above. What is a likely explanation for machine-related costs
being so high? What might explain why total machining hours for the deluxe doors (300,000 hours) are
the same as for the standard doors (300,000 hours)?
d. Using the activity-based costing data presented above,
1. compute the cost-driver rate for each overhead activity.
2. compute the revised manufacturing overhead cost per unit for each type of entry door.
3. compute the revised total cost to manufacture one unit of each type of entry door.
e. Is the deluxe door as profitable as the original data estimated? Why or why not?
f. What considerations need to be examined when determining a sales mix strategy?

47
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.

Answer:
a. Currently estimated deluxe-entry door total cost per unit is $260 = $180 + $80.
Currently estimated standard-entry door total cost per unit is $250 = $130 + $120.
Currently estimated deluxe-entry door profit per unit is $390 = $650 - $260.
Currently estimated standard-entry door profit per unit is $225 = $475 - $250.
b. Support manufacturing costs are currently allocated based on direct labor dollars. Because the deluxe
doors are manufactured using the new robotics system, it appears that less direct labor is needed to
manufacture each unit in the deluxe product line.
c. The high machine-related costs are probably a result of purchasing the new robotics equipment for
the deluxe product line. Yes, the total number of machine hours is the same for each product line, but the
deluxe line uses 6 machine hours per unit (300,000 mh / 50,000 units), while the standard product line
only uses 0.75 machine hours per unit (300,000 mh / 400,000 units). By evaluating machine hours per
unit rather than total machine hours, these numbers make more sense.
d1. Manufacturing overhead cost driver rates:
Setup activity is $1,000/setup = $500,000/500 setups.
Machine-related activity is $73.33/machine hour = $44,000,000/600,000 machine hours.
Packing activity is $20/shipment = $5,000,000/250,000 shipments.
d2. Revised overhead costs per unit:
Deluxe-entry door is $468 per unit
= [($1,000 × 400) + ($73.33 × 300,000) + ($20 × 50,000)] / 50,000 units.
Standard-entry door is $65.25 per unit
= [($1,000 × 100) + ($73.33 × 300,000) + ($20 × 200,000)] / 400,000 units.
d3. Revised total cost per unit for the deluxe-entry door is $648.00 = $180.00 + $468.00.
Revised total cost per unit for the standard-entry door is $195.25 = $130.00 + $65.25.
e. No, the deluxe door is not as profitable as originally estimated because the deluxe door requires a
disproportionate share of the overhead activities (the robotics system) and thus, more of the overhead
costs are assigned to the deluxe door when using an ABC system.
Revised profit per unit for the deluxe-entry door is $2.00 = $650.00 - $648.00.
Revised profit per unit for the standard-entry door is $279.75 = $475.00 - $195.25.
Currently estimated deluxe-entry door profit per unit is $390 = $650 - $260.
Currently estimated standard-entry door profit per unit is $225 = $475 - $250.
f. First, the sales-mix strategy ought to consider the current and future market demands for the two
types of entry doors. Other considerations include the capacity-related constraints of the robotics system,
other equipment, and the facilities. The fact that customers may be willing to pay more for the deluxe
doors should be considered when evaluating the profitability of each product line. Costs do not drive a
sales-mix strategy.

a. Traditional system:
Operating profit per unit for Brass faucets is $5 = $40 - ($8 + 15 + 12).
b. The activity-cost-driver rate for setup costs is $4,900 per setup hour = $465,500/95, and for
inspection costs is $150 per inspection hour = $405,000/2,700.
c. ABC system:
Overhead costs per unit for Brass faucets are $9.40 per unit.
30,000 units in projected sales / 1000 units per batch = 30 batches;
30 batches × 1 setup hour per batch = 30 setup hours;
30 batches × 30 inspection hours per batch = 900 inspection hours.
30 setup hours × $4,900 = $147,000/30,000 units = $4.90/unit
900 inspection hours × $150 = $135,000/30,000 units = $4.50/unit
Overhead costs for Brass faucets ($4.90 + $4.50) = $9.40 per unit.
Operating profit per unit for Brass faucets is $7.60 = $40 - ($8 + 15 + 9.40).
d. Traditional system:
Operating profit per unit for Brass faucets is $5.00.
ABC system: Operating profit per unit for Brass faucets is $7.60.
Because the products do not all require the same proportionate shares of the support resources of
setup hours and inspection hours, the ABC system provides different results than the traditional system,
which allocates overhead costs on the basis of direct labor hours. The ABC system considers some

Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.

Answer:
a.
activity-cost-driver rate = packaging overhead / packaging hours
= $150,000 / 950 hours
= $157.89 per packaging hour
b.
1. To compute the estimated overhead costs for a batch of sugar cookies (using the ABC system),
first calculate the activity-cost-driver rate for the oven activity.
activity-cost-driver rate

= oven overhead / oven hours
= $210,000 / 1,900 hours
= $110.53 per oven hour

Then calculate the overhead for a 1,000 cookie batch by multiplying the number of activity hours per
batch by the appropriate activity-cost-driver rate for each of the relevant overhead activities and sum to
get the total overhead for the batch.
(1 x $110.53) + (.5 x $157.89) = $189.48
2. To compute the estimated operating profit for a batch of sugar cookies (using the ABC system),
subtract the costs from the revenues:
Revenue
Direct Material
Direct Labor
Overhead

= 1,000 * $0.75 = $ 750.00
= 1,000 * $.015 = ($150.00)
= 1,000 * $.02 = ($ 20.00)
= ($189.48)

Operating Profit

= $ 390.52

c. 1. To compute the estimated overhead costs for a batch of sugar cookies (using the traditional
system), first calculate the overhead rate per direct labor hour.
Overhead per direct labor hour

= Total Overhead / Total Direct Labor Hours
= $ 360,000 / 2,400 hours
= $ 150.00 per direct labor hour

Since it takes 1 direct labor hour per 1,000 sugar cookies, the overhead is $150.00
2. To compute the estimated operating profit for a batch of sugar cookies (using the traditional
system), subtract the costs from the revenues:
Revenue
Direct Material
Direct Labor
Overhead

= 1,000 * $0.75 = $ 750.00
= 1,000 * $.015 = ($150.00)
= 1,000 * $.02 = ($ 20.00)
= ($150.00)

Operating Profit

= $ 430.00

d. Traditional system:
Operating profit per batch of sugar cookies is $430.00.
ABC system: Operating profit per batch of sugar cookies is $390.52.
Because the products do not all require the same proportionate shares of the direct labor resources,
the allocation of the total overhead on that basis is not as accurate as using the ABC system. The ABC
system allocates the overhead based on activity levels for the specific categories as well as activity usage
by the product lines.

Answer the following questions using the information below:
Whitman Printing has contracts to complete weekly supplements required by forty-six customers. For
the year 20X5, manufacturing overhead cost estimates total $840,000 for an annual production capacity
of 12 million pages.
For 2010 Whitman Printing decided to evaluate the use of additional cost pools. After analyzing
manufacturing overhead costs, it was determined that number of design changes, setups, and inspections
are the primary manufacturing overhead cost drivers. The following information was gathered during the
analysis:
Cost pool
Manufacturing overhead costs
Design changes
$ 120,000
Setups
640,000
Inspections
80,000
Total manufacturing overhead costs $840,000

Activity level
200 design changes
4,000 setups
16,000 inspections

During 2010, two customers, Money Managers and Hospital Systems, are expected to use the following
printing services:

22) At Deutschland Electronics, product lines are charged for call center support costs based on sales
revenue. Last year's summary of call center operations revealed the following:
Surveillance Products
Number of calls for information
1,000
Average call length for information
3 minutes
Number of calls for warranties
300
Average call length for warranties
7 minutes
Sales revenue
$8,000,000

Specialty Products
4,000
8 minutes
1,200
15 minutes
$5,000,000

Deutschland Electronics currently allocates call center support costs using a rate of 0.5% of sales
revenue.
Required:
a. Compute the amount of call center support costs allocated to each product line under the current
system.
b. Assume Deutschland decides to use the average call length for information to assign last year's
support costs. Does this allocation method seem more appropriate than percentage of sales? Why or why
not?
c. Assume Deutschland decides to use the numbers of calls for information and for warranties to
assign last year's support costs of $65,000. Compute the amount of call center support costs assigned to
each product line under this revised ABC system.
d. Deutschland Electronics assigns bonuses based on departmental profits. How might the Specialty
Products manager try to obtain higher profits for next year if support costs are assigned based on the
average call length for information?
e. Discuss the barriers for implementing ABC for this call center.

Answer:
a. Call center support costs allocated to surveillance products is $40,000 = 0.005 × $8,000,000 and to
specialty products is $25,000 = 0.005 × $5,000,000.
b. Yes, average call length appears to be a more appropriate allocation method because it allocates
more support costs to specialty products, which consume a greater portion of the call center's resources.
c. $65,000 of support costs / 6,500 total calls (Surveillance 1,000 + 300 + Specialty 4,000 + 1,200) =
$10 per call. Call center support costs allocated to surveillance products is $13,000 = 1,300 calls × $10
per call, and to specialty products is $52,000 = 5,200 calls × $10 per call.
d. To increase profits, Specialty Product managers would want less cost allocated to their departments.
Therefore, if support cost allocation were based on length of call, Specialty Products management may
emphasize keeping calls for their department short and to the point, rather than emphasizing
understanding and helping the caller.
e. Poor model design or poor analytical interpretation and accountability consequences may function as
barriers to using ABC assignments for the call center activities. It is also important to recognize that the
call volumes from this year may be an anomaly so that in an average year, the current allocation rate on
sales may not be as distortive as it appears for this year.

23) The Guy Fawkes Company is noted for an exceptionally impressive line of Mardi Gras masks. Guy
Fawkes has established the following selling and distribution support activity-cost pools and their
corresponding activity drivers for the year 2010:
Activity
Marketing
Customer service
Order execution
Warehousing

Cost
$60,000
20,000
10,000
10,000

Cost driver
$500,000 of sales
5,000 customer
100 orders
50 product lines

Required:
a. Determine the activity-cost-driver rate for each of the four selling and distribution activities.
b. Under what circumstances is it appropriate to use each of the activity-cost drivers?
c. Describe at least one possible negative behavioral consequence for each of the four activity-cost
drivers.
Answer:
a. Activity-cost driver rate for Marketing = 12% of sales = $60,000/$500,000.
Activity-cost driver rate for Customer Service = $4 per customer = $20,000/5,000.
Activity-cost driver rate for Order Execution = $100 per order = $10,000/100.
Activity-cost driver rate for Warehousing = $200 per order = $10,000/50.
b. For marketing, using 12% of stipulated sales is appropriate when management wants to limit
marketing costs to a budgeted proportion to sales. Using the number of customers for customer service
is appropriate when the customer service costs are similar enough to use the average for all customers.
Using the number of orders for order execution is appropriate when all orders are sufficiently alike in
terms of resources used that they can be averaged. Using the number of product lines for warehousing is
appropriate when each product line requires similar proportions of the warehousing efforts.
c. For marketing, using 12% of sales limits the marketing activities to an arbitrary amount without
consideration for potential opportunities. Using the number of customers for customer service can lead
to customer service initiatives to limit the amount of time servicing each customer to cause the number
of customers serviced to increase. Using the number of orders for order execution can result in
purchasers splitting orders to increase the numbers of orders executed. Using the number of product
lines for warehousing can lead warehouse personnel to designate more product line differences in the
warehouse.

24) How are cost drivers selected in activity-based costing systems?
Answer: First, indirect costs are divided into homogeneous cost pools and classified as output unitlevel, batch-level, product-sustaining, or facility-sustaining costs. The cost pools correspond to
activities. Costs are allocated to products, services, or customers using activity drivers or cost-allocation
bases that have a cause-and-effect relationship with each cost pool.
Choices about how to economize on the number of activity-cost drivers, how to isolate events (because
activities triggered by the same event often can use the same activity cost driver), and which cost drivers
to select are influenced by the fact that the benefit of obtaining cost driver information needs to exceed
implementation costs.

Objective: 3, 8

25) Do activity-based costing systems always provide more accurate product costs than conventional
cost systems? Why or why not?
Answer: No. Traditional systems contain smaller and fewer cost distortions when the traditional
systems' unit-level assignments and the alternative activity-cost drivers are relatively similar in
proportion to each other. Still, the use of unit-level measures to assign indirect costs is more likely to
undercost low-volume products and more complex products. Both traditional product-costing systems
and ABC product-costing systems seek to assign all manufacturing costs to products. Cost distortions
occur when a mismatch (incorrect association) occurs between the way support costs are incurred and
the basis for their assignment to individual products.

26) How can the need for a more refined costing system be identified?
Answer: Signs that there is a need for a more refined costing system include the following:
a. Significant amounts of indirect costs are allocated using only one or two cost pools.
b. All or most indirect costs are identified as output unit-level costs rather than batch-level, productsustaining, or facility-sustaining activities.
c. Products make diverse demands on resources because of differences in volume, process steps, batch
size, or complexity.
d. Products that a company is well suited to make and sell show small profits; whereas, products that a
company is less suited to make and sell show large profits.
e. Operations staff have significant disagreements with the accounting staff about the costs of
manufacturing and marketing products and services.

27) What is activity-based management and how can it be used to improve the profitability of a
company?
Answer: Activity-based management is a method of management decision making that uses activitybased costing information to improve customer satisfaction and profitability. Some of the typical issues
that require a refined costing system (such as ABC) are pricing and product mix decisions, cost
reduction initiatives, streamlining of processes, and decisions that can lead to improved product design
based on knowledge of detailed costs of the existing product lines. The gathering of timely and accurate
information is one of the crucial steps in the decision-making process. A properly designed ABC system
will be likely to efficiently provide detailed costing information to managers in companies that
manufacture and distribute diverse product lines.

Reworked units are unacceptable units of production that are subsequently repaired and sold as
acceptable finished goods. Defective units of product (such as pagers, computer disk drives, computers,
and telephones) detected during production or immediately after production but before units are shipped
to customers, can sometimes be reworked and sold as good products.
Scrap is material left over when making a product. It has low sales value compared with the sales value
of the product. Examples are shavings and short lengths from woodworking operations and edges left
over from plastic molding operations.

21) What are the objectives in accounting for spoilage?
Answer: The key objectives in accounting for spoilage are determining the magnitude of the costs of the
spoilage and distinguishing between the costs of normal and abnormal spoilage. To effectively manage a
company (or a division of a business), a manager needs information concerning how his business is
performing. Spoilage is a cost which should be controlled and minimized. The dimensions of the cost
must be known (the dollar amount of the spoilage). The accounting system must be capable of
determining the dollar amount of the spoilage costs while distinguishing between normal and abnormal
spoilage. This information must be reported and available to management on a timely basis.

Craft Concept manufactures small tables in its Processing Department. Direct materials are added at the
initiation of the production cycle and must be bundled in single kits for each unit. Conversion costs are
incurred evenly throughout the production cycle. Before inspection, some units are spoiled due to
nondetectible materials defects. Inspection occurs when units are 50% converted. Spoiled units generally

Answer the following questions using the information below:
Cartwright Custom Carpentry manufactures chairs in its Processing Department. Direct materials are
included at the inception of the production cycle and must be bundled in single kits for each unit.
Conversion costs are incurred evenly throughout the production cycle. Inspection takes place as units are
placed into production. After inspection, some units are spoiled due to nondetectible material defects.
Spoiled units generally constitute 3% of the good units. Data provided for March 20X5 are as follows:
WIP, beginning inventory 3/1/20X5

43) Endicott Shoes manufactures shoes. All direct materials are included at the inception of the
production process. For March, there were 1,400 units in beginning inventory with a direct material cost
of $700. Direct materials totaled $15,000 for the month. Work-in-process records revealed that 35,000
units were started in March and that 30,000 were finished. Normal spoilage of 2% of units finished was
incurred. Ending work-in-process units are complete in respect to direct materials costs. Spoilage is not
detected until the process is complete. Endicott uses the weighted-average method.
Required:
a. What are the direct materials costs assigned to completed good units when spoilage units are
recognized or when they are ignored?
b. What are the direct material amounts allocated to the work-in-process ending inventory when
spoilage units are recognized or ignored?
Answer:
a. Equivalent units (spoilage recognized) = 1,400 + 35,000 = 36,400
Equivalent units (spoilage ignored)
= 35,800

47) Weather Instruments assembles products from component parts. It has two departments that process
all products. During January, the beginning work in process in the assembly department was half
complete as to conversion and complete as to direct materials. The beginning inventory included
$12,000 for materials and $4,000 for conversion costs. Overhead is applied at the rate of 50% of direct
manufacturing labor costs. Ending work-in-process inventory in the assembly department was 40%
complete. All spoilage is considered normal and is detected at the end of the process.
Beginning work in process in the finishing department was 75% complete as to conversion and ending
work in process was 25% converted. Direct materials are added at the end of the process. Beginning
inventories included $16,000 for transferred-in costs and $10,000 for direct manufacturing labor costs.
Overhead in this department is equal to direct manufacturing labor costs. Additional information about

48) Harriet has been reviewing the accounting system for her company and she is very concerned about
the accounting for spoilage. It appears that spoilage is accounted for only at the end of the processing
cycle. While this concept is acceptable in general, Harriet believes that a better method can be found to
properly account for the spoilage when it occurs. She believes that there must be something better than
the weighted-average method of accounting for spoilage. She would like the company to use a method
that provides closer tracking of the spoilage with the accounting for the spoilage.
Required:
Discuss the problems Harriet is having with the accounting system.
Answer: The main problem Harriet has is that she does not understand the accounting system. The use
of weighted-average or FIFO is not for addressing the problems of spoilage tracking. While the methods
differ slightly in the tracking of costs, FIFO keeps beginning inventories separate, and the point of
accounting for spoilage is not affected by the accounting method. If the company can account for
spoilage at different stages of completion, these stages can be converted into percentage of completion
points, and the spoilage can be accounted for as the process completes each stage.

49) Spoilage can be a significant cost for many organizations. Discuss when spoilage might happen and
how the costs of normal spoilage get allocated.
Answer: Spoilage may occur at various stages of the production process. In general, the cost of spoiled
units is equal to the all costs incurred in producing the spoiled units up to the point of inspection.
The costs of normal spoilage are allocated to units in ending work-in-process inventory. The most
common approach is to presume that normal spoilage occurs at the inspection point in the production
cycle and to allocate its cost over all units that have passed that point during the accounting period. One
cost-benefit decision to be made is when to do inspections. Naturally, the earlier the spoilage is caught,
the less costly it will be as the conversion costs will be lower in the early stages of production. The costs
of performing inspections can be compared to the expected savings from reducing the spoilage costs as
part of the determination of when in the process the inspections should happen.

7) Shazam Machines produces numerous types of money change machines. All machines are made in
the same production department and many use exactly the same processes. Because customers have such
different demands for the machine characteristics, the company uses a job-costing system.
Unfortunately, some of the production managers have been upset for the last few months when their jobs
were charged with the spoilage that occurred over an entire processing run of several types of machines.
Some of the best managers have even threatened to quit unless the accounting system is changed.
Required:
What recommendations can you suggest to improve the accounting for spoilage?
Answer: Because the manufacturing process uses similar workstations for the products, it may be best
to let the spoilage be considered a manufacturing problem rather than a job problem. With this
assumption, the spoilage will be spread over the entire production process with each job being charged
an appropriate amount of spoilage, thereby relieving some jobs of bearing the entire burden of spoilage
just because they were being worked on when the machines or process malfunctioned.

5) Valentine Florists operate a flower shop. Because most of their orders are via telephone or fax,
numerous orders have to be reworked. The average cost of the reworked orders is $6: $3.75 for labor,
$1.50 for more flowers, and $0.75 for overhead. This ratio of costs holds for the average original order.
On a recent day, the shop reworked 48 orders out of 249. The original cost of the 48 orders totaled $720.
The average cost of all orders is $16.16, including rework, with an average selling price of $30
Required:
Prepare the necessary journal entry to record the rework for the day if the shop charges such activities to
Arrangement Department Overhead Control. Prepare a journal entry to transfer the finished goods to
Finished Goods Inventory.

7) When a unit has to be reworked, the rework may be classified in three ways. What are those ways,
and how does the accounting for each differ?
Answer: The rework may be (1) normal rework attributable to a specific job; (2) normal rework
common to all jobs; or (3) abnormal rework. If the rework is attributable to a specific job, then the cost
of such rework should be charged to that job. If the rework is common to all jobs, then the cost of the
rework should be charged to manufacturing overhead and spread across all jobs. If the rework is
abnormal rework then the cost of the rework should be charged as a loss to the period in which the
rework is required.

12) Busy Hands Craft Company is a small manufacturing company that specializes in arts and crafts
items. It recently bought an old textile mill that it has refurbished to manufacture and dye special cloth
to be sold in its craft shops. However, it discovered something new for its accounting system. The
company never before had finished goods that did not meet standard, leftover materials from processing
runs, or unacceptable outputs.
Required:
As the business consultant for the company, explain how it can handle the items mentioned. Include any
potential problems with the accounting procedures.
Answer: First, an explanation of each item is needed.
1. Rework units are those units that are defective but can be reworked and sold as acceptable finished
goods.
2. Scrap is leftover material that may have a minimal sales value. Scrap may be either sold, disposed,
or reused in another job or processing run.
3. Spoilage is the production outputs that cannot be reworked. These units are discarded or sold for
minimal value.
The potential problem with these areas is that they may be treated differently by the accounting system.
The company should establish an acceptable and consistent method of handling each area. A consistent
policy also aids the managers who are being evaluated by their department's efforts.

13) Explain the meaning of the terms spoilage, scrap, and rework. Provide an example of each. Is it
possible for a single firm to have all three from a single productive process?
Answer: Spoilage is units of production that do not meet the specifications required by customers for
good units, and are discarded or sold for reduced prices. An example of spoilage would be a damaged
pair of Levi's Jeans sold as a "second."
Rework is unacceptable units that are subsequently repaired and sold as acceptable finished goods. An
example of rework would be a pair of Jeans that might require some additional trimming before they
become acceptable.
Scrap is residual material that results from manufacturing a product; it has low retail sales value
compared with the total sales value of the product. An example of scrap would be any leftover material
from a cutting process that is too small to use in any other clothing.
As the above examples indicate, a single productive process might generate, spoilage, scrap, and rework
simultaneously.

14) You are the chief financial officer of a lumber mill, and you are becoming quite concerned about the
spoilage, scrap, and reworked items associated with your production processes. Your firm produces
mainly products for the building industry.
Required:
Discuss the problems associated with these items and the methods your company can use to reduce
spoilage, scrap, and reworked items.
Answer: The problems associated with these items include:
1. your company pays for the total raw material, not just the portion converted into a salable product;
2. the cost of disposing these unsalable or unused items, both the disposal costs and the costs and
problems associated with finding a landfill site or other disposal site;
3. these disposed or unused items can create an eyesore, and attract the wrath of the environmentalists;
and
4. developing high-value added products that can be produced from these various items.
The methods your company can use to reduce these items include:
1. calculating the costs of these problems because an accurate assessment of the total costs should
certainly provide an incentive to your firm to investigate possible actions;
2. exploring methods of redesigning the production process to minimize these costs; and
3. investing in more sophisticated capital equipment that can be designed to reduce these costs.

15) How can a company account for scrap? Include in your explanation a discussion of the two aspects
of accounting for scrap.
Answer: Since scrap is a residual material that results from manufacturing a product, it has a low sales
value as compared to the actual value of the product. The aspects of accounting for scrap are (1)
planning and control of the scrap (which includes the physical tracking), and (2) inventory costing
(which includes when and how scrap affects operating income).
Regarding the planning and control of the scrap it is important to measure how much scrap is being
generated (by weighing or counting the pieces) and then keep records to indicate where the scrap is
keeping a log of quantity and location. This will help to develop records that can be used to compare the
amount of scrap generated to the expected amount generated based on budgets and units of good product
completed. Also, since scrap has a value, it will reduce the likelihood that the scrap gets stolen.
In terms of the cost accounting for the scrap there are two options regarding when the scrap is
potentially recognized in the accounting records: (1) at the time the scrap is produced, or (2) at the time
the scrap is sold. If the dollar value of the scrap is immaterial, the simplest accounting method is to
record the quantity of scrap returned to the storage area and then regard the scrap sales as a separate line
item in the income statement. If the scrap is material in value, then it can be recognized at the time of its
production and can have journal entries returning it to a materials control asset account (as a debit) and
then credited when it later gets sold.

16) For each of the following (actual real-world examples), develop products that can be sold from the
listed scrap.
a. The Federal Reserve Banks destroy old money. Burning this money is usually forbidden under the
environmental laws of most municipalities.
b. A manufacturer of cotton undergarments for prisoners has much cotton left over. The manufacturer
is located in a very rural area of Alabama.
c. A hog renderer has hog bristles as a result of the slaughtering process.
Answer:
a. The Federal Reserve Banks bag up the shredded money and sell it in gift shops. This is a very
efficient use of the scrap. The purchasers pay a price in excess of what the Federal Reserve would
receive from any other source. Other uses might include selling for use as packaging materials.
b. The above manufacturer sells the scrap for use in the cleaning of guns. Other uses would include
similar cleaning uses or dyeing the cloth and selling it for ornaments.
